# Java Jars
My learnings with [The Complete Java Certification Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-practical-java-development)

## How to Install
I'm using Ubuntu, and I recommend everyone to use this link [https://linuxconfig.org/oracle-java-installation-on-ubuntu-20-04-focal-fossa-linux](https://linuxconfig.org/oracle-java-installation-on-ubuntu-20-04-focal-fossa-linux) to install JDK. I almost managed to brick my OS editing `.pam_envinronment` mistakenly following other tutorials (bottom line, don't do it)

## Runtime
- Variables point to the memory location of objects
- The memory is allocated when the program start running
- Classes are the definition. Ex: `public class Something {}`
- Objects are the created instances when we do `new Something()`
